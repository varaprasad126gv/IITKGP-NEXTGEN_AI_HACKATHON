# IITKGP NEXTGEN AI Hackathon – Eco Genesis

## Project Title
AI-Powered Narrative Consistency & Misinformation Detection System

## Team
- Vadde Varaprasad
- Akula Charan

## Problem Statement
The rapid growth of AI-generated and human-written content has increased the spread of misinformation, logical contradictions, and misleading narratives. Existing systems focus mainly on external fact-checking and fail to analyze internal narrative consistency and future implications.

## Solution Overview
We propose a Multi-Agent AI Narrative Intelligence System that evaluates text for:
- Logical contradictions
- Negation conflicts
- Contextual coherence
- Temporal inconsistencies
- Future plausibility

Independent AI agents debate the input text, and a centralized AI Judge generates an explainable verdict.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NLP & Transformer Models
- Multi-Agent Reasoning
- Rule-based Contradiction Detection
- Streamlit (UI)

## Key Features
- Explainable AI verdicts
- Confidence scoring
- Future risk prediction
- Lightweight & scalable
